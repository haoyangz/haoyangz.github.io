We describe protein interaction quantitation (PIQ), 
a computational method for modeling the magnitude and 
shape of genome-wide DNase I hypersensitivity profiles to 
identify transcription factor (TF) binding sites. Through the 
use of machine-learning techniques, PIQ identified binding 
sites for >700 TFs from one DNase I hypersensitivity analysis 
followed by sequencing (DNase-seq) experiment with accuracy 
comparable to that of chromatin immunoprecipitation followed 
by sequencing (ChIP-seq). We applied PIQ to analyze 
DNase-seq data from mouse embryonic stem cells 
differentiating into prepancreatic and intestinal endoderm. 
We identified 120 and experimentally validated eight ‘pioneer’ 
TF families that dynamically open chromatin. Four pioneer 
TF families only opened chromatin in one direction from their 
motifs. Furthermore, we identified ‘settler’ TFs whose genomic 
binding is principally governed by proximity to open chromatin. 
Our results support a model of hierarchical TF binding in which 
directional and nondirectional pioneer activity shapes the 
chromatin landscape for population by settler TFs.
